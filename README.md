# uList Repository
Welcome to the uList repository – a glimpse into the world of experimentation with AI-driven automation.

# Introduction
# uList
This project, aptly named uList, is an experiment in automation guided by artificial intelligence. It doesn't serve any practical purpose beyond showcasing a scripted method for merging preexistem lists. It's a product of AI experimentation, and I want to be transparent—It may contain bugs.

# Disclaimer
This repository is fully maintained by AI. It's an experiment and does not offer practical functionality beyond demonstrating a scripted method for merging pre-existing lists. As a result:

Limited Practical Use: uList is not designed to solve real-world problems or provide tangible benefits at this point.

Bug Possibility: Given its experimental nature, there might be bugs or imperfections. It's not advisable to use uList for any functional purposes.

# Key Features
AI-Generated Scripting: The merging script in this repository is entirely created by artificial intelligence, showcasing the potential of automated processes.

If you want to merge multiple filter lists for uBlock Origin efficiently using GitHub, you can follow these general steps:


# How to Use
If you want to merge multiple filter lists for uBlock Origin efficiently using GitHub, you can follow these general steps:
## 1. create a New Repository:
Start by creating a new GitHub repository where you will host your merged filter list.

## 2. Clone the Repository:
*Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.*

````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
````

## 3. Create a Script or Use Command Line:

* You can use a scripting language (like Python or Bash) to automate the process of fetching and merging filter lists.

* Create a script that reads URLs from a list and appends the rules to a single file.

````python
filter_lists = [
    'https://example.com/filterlist1.txt',
    'https://example.com/filterlist2.txt',
    # Add more filter list URLs as needed
]

merged_rules = []

for url in filter_lists:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        merged_rules.extend(response.text.split('\n'))

with open('merged_filterlist.txt', 'w') as merged_file:
    merged_file.write('\n'.join(merged_rules))
````

## 4. Commit and Push:

*Commit the changes and push them to your GitHub repository.*


````bash
git add merged_filterlist.txt
git commit -m "Merge filter lists"
git push origin master
````

##5. Host the Merged Filter List:

* Make sure the merged filter list file (merged_filterlist.txt) is accessible via a raw URL on GitHub. You can use the "Raw" button on GitHub to get the raw URL.

## 6. Update uBlock Origin:

* In uBlock Origin, go to the "Settings" tab, find the "Filter lists" section, and add the raw URL of your merged filter list.

By following these steps, you can efficiently merge multiple filter lists and host the merged list on GitHub for use with uBlock Origin. Keep in mind that regularly updating and maintaining the merged filter list is crucial to ensure that it stays effective over time.
